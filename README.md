## This work presents the solution to one of the kaggle competition that I took part in which is WELFake news classification using Machine Learning methods, more precisely Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Na√Øve Bayes.


(WELFake) is a dataset of 72,134 news articles with 35,028 real and 37,106 fake news. For this, authors merged four popular news datasets (i.e. Kaggle, McIntire, Reuters, BuzzFeed Political) to prevent over-fitting of classifiers and to provide more text data for better ML training.
