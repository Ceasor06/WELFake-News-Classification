## This work presents the solution to one of the kaggle competition that I took part in which is WELFake news classification using Machine Learning methods, more precisely Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Na√Øve Bayes.


Handwriting recognition, also known as Handwritten Text Recognition, is the ability of a computer to receive and interpret intelligible handwritten input from sources such as paper documents, photographs, touch screens and other devices. 

Many current systems use ***Discrete Hidden Markov Vision***-based model or combination of ***Neural Network (NN)*** and ***Hidden Markov Model
(HMM)*** for recognition. In this project, we will use SVM; Support Vector Machine. Support Vector Machine or SVM is one of the most popular Supervised Learning algorithms, which is used for Classification as well as Regression problems. However, primarily, it is used for Classification problems in Machine Learning.

## Dataset

Dataset used was the MNIST data that is a database of handwritten digits, the 'pixel values' of each image comprise the features, and the actual number between 0-9 is the label.

***This is what dataset looks like:***

Each image is of 28 x 28 pixels, and each pixel forms a feature, there are 785 features and 5 rows making of 42000 training samples.

In this project, we took a sample size of about 10-12% of the training sample in which we got accuracy upto 95%.
